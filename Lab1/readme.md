The purpose of Lab 1 is to explore the IT1025 course set-up, examine the history of computing and get up and running with GitHub. IT1025 covers a wide-range of computing topics with a primary goal of assisting in determining student passions in IT.  IT history has many interesting facets. One of particular interest was... Regardless of one's passion in IT, frameworks such as GitHub are useful to create, update and maintain any type of file and work in an organized repository.

## Information System Components

The five components of an information system are hardware, software, data, people and process. The first three are more technical, while the latter two lean towards networking and communication. Hardware is actual physical technology, such as computers, keyboards, disk drives and flash drives, whereas software is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Operating systems such as Windows, Android, or Apple are all examples of software. Data is also non-physical: a collection of facts that are collected together for reference or statistics, such as names, addresses, prices, and costs. People also make up an important part of an information system. User support staff, systems analysts, programmers, CEOs of tech companies, and many others contribute towards its success. Lastly, process is the series of the steps taken to achieve a desired outcome, such as re-engineering and resource planning in business procedures.
## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture

Client-Server Architecture is a form of networking that allows users to connect to the Local Area Network by connecting their device to a central computer called a "server." Email, instant messaging, and social media are all examples of this: multiple users accessing the same data at the same time. GitHub fits the client-server model because it allows users to come together on the same website for a common goal. Multiple people can make separate changes to web pages at the same time. By allowing the user to host a central respository in a remote server where others can easily access it, Github is an important hosting platform for collaboration in technology.

## Conclusion

Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
