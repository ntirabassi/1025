## Executive Summary


## Information System Components

The five components of an information system are hardware, software, data, people and process. The first three are more technical, while the latter two lean towards networking and communication. Hardware is actual physical technology, such as computers, keyboards, disk drives and flash drives, whereas software is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Operating systems such as Windows, Android, or Apple are all examples of software. Data is also non-physical: a collection of facts that are collected together for reference or statistics, such as names, addresses, prices, and costs. People also make up an important part of an information system. User support staff, systems analysts, programmers, CEOs of tech companies, and many others contribute towards its success. Lastly, process is the series of the steps taken to achieve a desired outcome, such as re-engineering and resource planning in business procedures.
## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture

Client-Server Architecture is a form of networking that allows users to connect to the Local Area Network by connecting their device to a central computer called a "server." Email, instant messaging, and social media are all examples of this: multiple users accessing the same data at the same time. GitHub fits the client-server model because it allows users to come together on the same website for a common goal. Multiple people can make separate changes to web pages at the same time. By allowing the user to host a central respository in a remote server where others can easily access it, Github is an important hosting platform for collaboration in technology.

### Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides users with mobile access to data and applications, making the PC more of a part of the communications channel rather than a repository of programs and information. It is the use of hardware or software off-site that is accessed over networks for computing needs. Instead of hosting systems or applications on a hard drive, users can host virtual/online servers that connect to their computers through secure networks. Google apps like Gmail and Google Drive are examples of this, as well as Dropbox, Microsoft Office, and Amazon Web Services.

## Conclusion
Lab 1 served as an excellent introduction to the IT1025 course and also introduced me to topics and forms of technology that I was previously unaware of. It was interesting to learn about how technology connects people from every part of the world in different ways, and how advanced systems have made it possible for businesses and individual users to navigate and accomplish tasks on the interests. Most of terms were new to me, and I took the time to further research each term in order to familiarize myself with them for the class. I had never used GitHub before, so it took a little time to grow accustomed to it, but now I am excited to further explore it as we continue forward.
