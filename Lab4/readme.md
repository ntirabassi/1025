## Python IDLE
Both the shell and the file editor in Python IDLE look very similiar; however, there are a few differences. The interactive shell is what opens at startup and is useful for running Python instructions one at a time. The file editor is more useful for writing entire Python programs. It lets a user type in various instructions, save the file, and run the program. The way a user can tell the shell and file editor apart is that the shell window will have the ">>>" prompt on the left side, whereas the file editor will not.
## Code Examples
### Variable:
A variable is where you can store a single value in the computer's memory. This is helpful for using an expression or value later in a program. A variable is intialized the first time a value is stored in it, and you can replace old values by assigning new ones, which is called overwriting the variable. An example of a variable would be the name "bacon." It is like a labeled box that will contain a value. The author uses the variable names "spam," "bacon," and "eggs" because of the Monty Python sketch called "Spam."
### Assignment statement:
In order to store a value into a variable, you must use an assignment statement. An assignment statement consists of a variable name, am equal sign (which is called the assignment operator), and the value to be stored. An example of this would be "bacon = 5," where "bacon" is the variable and "5" is the value. You would now be able to use "bacon" is place of a 5 anywhere in your code.
