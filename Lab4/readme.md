## Python IDLE
Both the shell and the file editor in Python IDLE look very similiar; however, there are a few differences. The interactive shell is what opens at startup and is useful for running Python instructions one at a time. The file editor is more useful for writing entire Python programs. It lets a user type in various instructions, save the file, and run the program. The way a user can tell the shell and file editor apart is that the shell window will have the ">>>" prompt on the left side, whereas the file editor will not.
## Code Examples
### Variable:
A variable is where you can store a single value in the computer's memory. This is helpful for using an expression or value later in a program. A variable is intialized the first time a value is stored in it, and you can replace old values by assigning new ones, which is called overwriting the variable. An example of a variable would be the name "bacon." It is like a labeled box that will contain a value. The author uses the variable names "spam," "bacon," and "eggs" because of the Monty Python sketch called "Spam."
### Assignment statement:
In order to store a value into a variable, you must use an assignment statement. An assignment statement consists of a variable name, am equal sign (which is called the assignment operator), and the value to be stored. An example of this would be "bacon = 5," where "bacon" is the variable and "5" is the value. You would now be able to use "bacon" is place of a 5 anywhere in your code.
### Function:
A function in Python is like a mini program within your program. It tells the program what to do. When writing a function name, the opening and closing parentheses at the end identify it as the name of a function. An example of a function would be "print('Hello')." The print function is telling the program to print the word "Hello."
### Three data types:
The three most common data types are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. An integer data type are values that are whole numbers, such as 3, 8, or  76. Any number with a decimal point, such as 6.94, are floating-point numbers. Integers are usually referred to as "int," and floating-point numbers are called "floats." The last data type is strings, or "strs." These are text values, which must always be started and ended with single quotes, so that Python knows where the string begins and ends. Strings with no characters in them are called blank strings.
## Graphics
### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Small images lose their qulaity when enlarged, due to thousands of tiny pixels. This type of image is raster. When raster images are viewed at their original size, or smaller, the pixels are invisible. They become more apparent when you zoom in or increase the sie of the image. A raster image would be most appropriate used as a photo on a website that doesn't need to be particularly large, such as a profile photo. The difference in vector graphics is that they can be made into any size without losing quality. This is because they rendered using a special form of geometry, rather than pixels. Vectors are best used as large graphics or logos that can easily be resized as needed.
