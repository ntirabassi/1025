## Executive Summary 
During the course of this lab, I was able to explore different types of programming and get experience putting these techniques into practice. File compression can benefit computer users of all kinds, not just programmers, because it helps to reduce larger files that could take hours to upload. I also got to try object oriented programming, which is creating reeusable patterns of code, and can also help reduce time. I learned what attributes, methods, objects, and classes were, and was able to put it all together into a simple finished program.

## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
A zip file is a way of archiving multiple files into one file. Zip files are compressed, which means that the total file size is smaller, and takes up less space on the computer. This allows for the upload time to be shorter, so that you don’t have to wait for each individual file to upload. The recipients are also able to download it more quickly
### Compression and File Size
The size of the svg graphic file shrunk from 14.5 KB to 3.03 KB after it was compressed. An SVG file is much larger than a jpg file, which is smaller and more compressed. SVGs are vector based and are used to mainly editing and scaling images to any size. However, since it is larger, it takes more time to upload and send places, whereas a JPG, although not ideal for editing, is better used for small images that are finished and photos that do not need enlargement.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
A variable stored in an instance or class is called an attribute. Attributes are used to implement access controls of the class. In the shark class, the two attributes are swim and be_awesome. These are called using the dot operator (.). In this case, the attribute is a method.
### Methods:
Methods are a special kind of function that are defined with a class. The shark object Sammy is using the two methods swim(self) and be_awesome(self). Because the keyword self is a parameter of the methods as defined in the Shark class, the sammy object gets passed to the methods. The self parameter ensures that the methods have a way of referring to object attributes.
### Constructor:
The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class instantiated. The program is able to output the following without your modifying anything within the object instantiation, because this method is automatically initialized. A constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It usually has the same name as the class, and can be used to set the values of the members of a object. 
### Class vs. Object
Classes are useful because they allow us to create many similar objects based on the same blueprint, and an object is the instance of a class. A class is an abstract description of something used to create more specific, concrete object.  The phrase “instantiating an object” means the same thing as “creating an object,” for example, defining one particular variation of an object within a class, giving it a name, and locating it in some physical place.
## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
An object of a class represents an entity and the basic building block. They are persons, places, or things that are relevant to the system that is being analyzed. In the Shark class, the objects would be sammy and Stevie, which would be the names of the sharks.
### Inheritance
Inheritance in OOP is when one class is created out of another class. The original (parent) class is known as the base class, and the child class is called a derived class. A derived class can be created so that it inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the base class. For example, in the shark class, the base class could “Shark”, and a derivative class could be a type of shark, such as “Great White.”
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Abstraction is the overarching process that we use to describe a real-life object - defining something into its attributes and methods to create a class. We abstract the real object into a class definition where we can then make instances of these class which are programming objects. In terms of the shark class, you could abstract sammy by adding different parameters, such as self, name, age, and then create methods that calls for them. The methods are then encapsulated in the methods of the class, such as “swim” or “be_awesome.” 
## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
UML is a standardized modeling language consisting of an integrated set of diagrams, developed to help system and software developers for visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. The goal of UML is to provide a standard notation that can be used by all object-oriented methods and to select and integrate the best elements of precursor notations.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, file compression, OOP, and UML are all ways that we can utilize our time during programming, by having faster file uploads and reeusable coding. The different names and types of OOP were a bit confusing for me to understand which was which at first, but when I created the program in IDLE, it made a lot more sense. I look forward to using these techniques in my own programming practice.
