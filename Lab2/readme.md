## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
In the performance of a hard drive, rotational speed of the platters, otherwise known as Disk RPM, directly impacts the latency and disk transfer rates. The faster the disk spins, the more data passes through. The latency is the average time is takes for the sector to rotate into position under a head, and the transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk platter. Therefore, the faster the latency, the faster the transfer rate will be.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Although not a disk, solid state drives (SSD) replace the traditional hard disk drive. Because hard disk drives have many complex moving parts, they often can be slow, and have physical problems such as dust or other disruptions. SSDs address these problems by having no spinning platter or moving heads, and data is stored in memory - which means no more waiting for spin-up time. Because the information on SSDs can be accessed immediately, there is no latency experiment when data is transferred. Lastly, less things go wrong mechanically because solid state drives can be sealed air tight unlike disk drives, which need air cushioning to function properly.
#### Random Access Memory
In order for a program or data to run on a computer, it needs to be entered into the RAM first. If the memory is too low, it might not be able to hold all the data that the CPU needs. Some data will then have to be kept back in the slow hard drive, making the data wait to be passed through. When this happens, it slows down the computer. With increased RAM, more data can be loaded onto the faster RAM, and the result is a faster performing computer.
64 or 32 bit data path refers to the number of bits of data that are transferred in one clock cycle, and the more bits there are, the faster the computer is. 64 bit means that the DIMM can transfer 64 bits of data at a time. SIMMs, which are older model RAMs, can only transfer 32 bit data paths.
### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is under the command of the control unit, and it performs all the mathematical operations inside the CPU. The control unit receives the instructions from the RAM, and then tells the ALU what type of operation to perform. The ALU performs the operation and then outputs the answer. The control unit also turns on the ALU's register using a set wire. The register is used to store numbers temporarily. The control unit turns on the enable wire to output whatever number is inside the register.
### CPU, Input & Output
The input converts physical unit to binary information. The input at a gas station would be the form of payment in order to receive the gas - either swiping the card or giving cash to the cashier. The station now has the amount of gas to put in the car. The user also inputs the type of gas they would like to receive.
The CPU is the central process unit that calculates information. At a gas station it would be the station itself. It calculates the amount of gas, the type of gas, and it also processes the payment. It also gives out instructions to the user.
The output converts information to physical output. Everything that the station calculated now comes out in the form of gas and goes into the car, completing the process. 
### Logic Gates 
A logic gate is a electric current with two inputs and one output. For an AND gate, if both inputs are switched on (carry 1's), the output will be 1 as well. For an OR gate, if either input is switched on, the output will be one. A truth table shows the output you can get (1 or 0) for every possible input. The difference between an AND and an OR truth table is that there are more chances for a 1 output with an OR gate than an AND gate.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is an organization dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. It is designed to serve professionals involved in electrical, electronic, and computing fields. They aim to foster awareness on ethical issues and promote ethical behavior. Their code of ethics include the safety, health, and welfare of the public, avoiding unlawful conduct, offering honest criticism, and treating all people fairly and with respect, among others. The organization prioritizes ethical considerations so that advancements in technology are made for the benefit of humanity and not just for profit.

## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
A binary number system is calculated by powers of 2, and a  decimal system is a base 10 system. A hexidecimal system, which is used to calculating higher numbers, uses a base 16 number system. It not only uses numbers 0-9 but also six letters: A-F. The computer uses binary to store data, not only becuase it's reliable, but because computers only understand 1s and 0s.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
The color #ab00ff can described as a mostly pure violet, being 67.1% red, 0% green, and 100% blue. It has a RGB value of R=171, G=0, and B=255, while its CMYK value is C=0.33, M=1, Y=0, and K=O. When choosing a color for a website, readability issures should considered, as well as contrast against black and white. Using a color grade system can help in choosing an accessible color pairing. #ab00ff is not a websafe color, and it is also too highly saturated, which can harm senstive eyes. It varies greatly for colorblind users, and is too bright and distracting for a website. Therefore, this color would be considered problematic, and other alternatives should be found.
