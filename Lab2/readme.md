### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
In the performance of a hard drive, rotational speed of the platters, otherwise known as Disk RPM, directly impacts the latency and disk transfer rates. The faster the disk spins, the more data passes through. The latency is the average time is takes for the sector to rotate into position under a head, and the transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk platter. Therefore, the faster the latency, the faster the transfer rate will be.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Although not a disk, solid state drives (SSD) replace the traditional hard disk drive. Because hard disk drives have many complex moving parts, they often can be slow, and have physical problems such as dust or other disruptions. SSDs address these problems by having no spinning platter or moving heads, and data is stored in memory - which means no more waiting for spin-up time. Because the information on SSDs can be accessed immediately, there is no latency experiment when data is transferred. Lastly, less things go wrong mechanically because solid state drives can be sealed air tight unlike disk drives, which need air cushioning to function properly.
#### Random Access Memory
In order for a program or data to run on a computer, it needs to be entered into the RAM first. If the memory is too low, it might not be able to hold all the data that the CPU needs. Some data will then have to be kept back in the slow hard drive, making the data wait to be passed through. When this happens, it slows down the computer. With increased RAM, more data can be loaded onto the faster RAM, and the result is a faster performing computer.
64 or 32 bit data path refers to the number of bits of data that are transferred in one clock cycle, and the more bits there are, the faster the computer is. 64 bit means that the DIMM can transfer 64 bits of data at a time. SIMMs, which are older model RAMs, can only transfer 32 bit data paths.
