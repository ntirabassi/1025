## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
In the performance of a hard drive, rotational speed of the platters, otherwise known as Disk RPM, directly impacts the latency and disk transfer rates. The faster the disk spins, the more data passes through. The latency is the average time is takes for the sector to rotate into position under a head, and the transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk platter. Therefore, the faster the latency, the faster the transfer rate will be.
