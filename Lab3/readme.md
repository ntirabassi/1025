## Software
Software is the set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. It is created through the process of programming, and without it, hardware would not be functional.
### Types of Software
Operating systems manage the hardware and create the interface betweeen the hardware and the user. These systems also provide a platform for software developers to write. Examples of operating system software would be Windows, Google, or Apple. Application software is the category of programs that do something useful for the user, such as Microsoft Word or iTunes. These types of programs perform specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, database management, video games, and browsing the web. Utility software includes programs that allow a person to fix or modifiy their computer, such as anti-malware software and programs that uninstall unwanted software.
### ERP
ERP, or Enterprise Resource Planning, is a system of integrated applications for managing businesses. It was developed to bring together entire organizations within one program, and in order to do that it utilizes a central database. An organization can purchase models for its ERP system that match specific needs, such as order entry, manufacturing, or planning. SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft are all examples of ERP. 

## Virtualization
Virtualization is a technology that lets you create useful IT services that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows a user to use a physical machine's full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
A common IT problem was that were many users and only a few machines to accomodate them. Virtualization was the natural solution to this because companies could partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating systems types and versions. As a result, servers started being used more efficiently, which then reduced the costs of purchase, set up, cooling and maintenance.
### Role of Hypervisor
Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources from virtual environments - the things that need those resources. They can rest on top of an operating system, or be installed directly onto hardware. Hypervisors take the physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them. When the virtual environment is running and a user or program issues an instruction that requires additional resources from the physical environment, the hypervisor relays the request to the physical system and caches the changes.
## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Python is a very simplistic and minimalistic coding language. It has a pseudo-code nature which means that it is a plain language description of steps in the algorithm, designed for human reading rather than a machine. This is one of Python's greatest strengths because it allows a user to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than trying to decipher the language itself.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A program written in a compiled language, such as C++, is converted from the source language using a compiler with various flags and options. When the program is run, the linker/loader software copies the program from the hard disk to memory and starts running it. 
With an interpreted language, like Python, the program is run directly from the source code, and it does not need compilation to binary. Internally, the program converts the source code into an intermediate form called byte codes and translates this into the native language of the computer and runs it. It makes the programs more portable and much easier to use as a result.
